<h2>Version 3.10 Release</h2>
<h3>New features and bug fixes for CBPlay.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assign Ctrl-P hot key to start a Plotted Move, ESC cancels, and 
  Enter accepts.</li>
  <li>Added ability to use markers in a Plotted Move.</li>
  <li>Upgrade multiplayer feature to support up to 26 players. The prior
  maximum was 8 players.</li>
  <li>Added ability to directly transfer ownership to another player.
  Previously you had to release ownership and then assign ownership.
  A possible use for this is to make it easy to pass a card to someone.</li>
  <li>Prompt and create multiple markers if dragged from marker tray while 
  holding the Ctrl key. For example: If the marker tray is set to deliver 
  random markers and the markers are graphical images of dice faces you 
  essentially have created a graphical die roller.</li>
  <li>Change piece X & X stagger maximums from 16 to 256. This is used by the
  Autostack feature.</li>
  <li>The die roller has extended maximum die face value to 32767. The prior
  maximum was 100.</li>
  <li>Added "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons to tray import dialog in 
      scenario editor.</li>
  <li>Added "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons to board selection dialog
      in scenario editor.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>None. (Sorry)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 3.03 Release</h2>
<h3>New features and bug fixes for CBPlay.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added ability to rotate the selected group of markers and/or pieces around the selection's center point. This can be used to "wheel" as set of playing pieces.</li>
  <li>Added ability to rotate pieces and markers down to a single degree of resolution.</li>
  <li>Added hot keys for "Action / Rotate Object - Incremental" (Ctrl-Shift+R) and "Action / Rotate Group - Incremental" 
      (Ctrl-Shift+G) menu commands. You'll need to delete your CyberBoard CBPlay.exe registry key to get the new hotkeys to work. 
      To do this you can Double-Click on the provided "CBPlayRegDel.reg" file.</li>
  <li>If pieces and/or markers are selected then the view will be centered on the selections when using the zoom feature.</li>
  <li>The mouse wheel scrolls the view horizontally or vertically based on location of the cursor. If it's 
      near the upper or lower edge of the view, the mouse wheel will scroll the view horizontally. Otherwise
      it's scrolled vertically.</li>
  <li>Bugfix: If the first action after starting a new move recording involved a random number (a die roll or a marker draw) 
      a fixed result was generated. Now the result is simply random. </li>
  <li>Bugfix: If an incremental rotation is the first action in a move recording, the incorrect game state is 
      stored in the move file. This caused a prompt to synchronize the game state when your opponent loaded the move file.</li>
  <li>Bugfix: Fixed the dialog used to enter text for pieces or markers to automatically wrap 
      text rather than horizontally scroll the edit box.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features and bug fixes for CBDesign.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>None. (Sorry)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 3.02 Release</h2>
<P>Patch release that fixes launching files by double-clicking on them.</P>

<h2>Version 3.00 Release</h2>
<P>A revamped user interface including such features as:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Dockable trays and markers.</li>
  <li>Tabs that allow direct selection of open windows.</li>
  <li>New XP menu style with icons.</li>
  <li>Customizable tool bars.</li>
  <li>Compatible with XP skins</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>65536 color (aka 16 bit color) support. Along with the new UI framework,
      this was a large chunk of the work for this release.</li>
  <li>Greatly improved color palette window:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The first 3 x 8 area from the left are standard colors along with a grey scale.</li>
    <li>The next 6 x 8 area are the custom colors that can be set in a variety 
        of ways.</li>
    <li>The box to the right of the 6 x 8 area is the current color mix 
        created by changing the bottom Hue picker and the Saturation/Value 
        picker on the far right.</li>
    <li>The 48 custom colors are saved with the gamebox file.</li>
    <li>You can double-click on a custom color to adjust it using a color
        setting dialog.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Playing boards can be rotated by 180 degrees during play.</li>
  <li>The message history window is now stand-alone and can be docked.</li>
  <li>Message history text is now color coded.</li>
  <li>Playback functionality is greatly improved:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The default hot key assignments have been changed: </li>
      <P>F2 - previous move</P>
      <P>F3 - next move</P>
      <P>F4 - next history entry</P>
      <P>F5 - close history playback</P>
      <P>F6 - toggle automatic playback</P>
    <li>The spacebar can be used to do "Next Move"s instead of F3.</li>
    <li>You can hit the "Next Move" command before the current move is totally 
        played back. With this you can blast through moves if you don't want 
        to see the time animated playback.</li>
    <li>You can enable an option that causes the "Next Move" command to
        automatically load the next history record when at the end of the
        current history record.</li>
    <li>You can turn on an option called "Automatic Playback (F6)". When you hit the
        "Next Move" command CyberBoard takes over and steps moves all the way to the
        end without you having to hit any keys. You hit the next move command
        again to abort the playback.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>New game files by default render locked objects underneath other non-locked
      pieces and markers. For backward compatibility reasons upgraded games 
      render locked objects in their current postions in the drawing order. 
      This option can be changed in the board properties dialog.</li>
  <li>All three zoom levels are available in the player program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.00 Release</h2>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>GameBox files now support internal compression of bitmap images. 
      The GameBox file size can now be greatly reduced. Multiple levels
      of compress are supported.</li>
  <li>GameBox files may now be password protected.</li>
  <li>The list of files recently opened (the so called LRU list) has 
      been increased to ten.</li>
  <li>When defining playing pieces there is an option allowing only the top 
      (active) side of a playing piece to be visible in select lists and
      piece trays while playing a game. This is intended for implementing 
      playing cards.</li>
  <li>Top drawing layer objects now have the option to be drawn above the 
      grid. They are rendered in a second pass after drawing the grid. 
      This allows tables and such to be placed on the board and still 
      have the grid on top of some terrain features that are drawn using 
      lines and polygons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to associate text with pieces and markers.</li>
  <li>Ability to rotate markers.</li>
  <li>Piece and markers can now be locked so they can't be selected.</li>
  <li>Supports geomorphic construction of boards having hex style cells.</li>
  <li>Supports shuffling (randomizing) pieces in trays and on the 
      playing board. One application would be for playing cards.</li>
  <li>The game player program now remembers layout of open 
      windows in a game or scenario. The layout is restored when the 
      file is reloaded.</li>
  <li>Playing piece and maker trays now support several visibility 
      and behavior options.</li>
  <li>If you drag a marker out of a group that is set to deliver random 
      markers AND you hold the CTRL key when the mouse button is released, 
      you will be prompted for the number of random markers to be created. 
      This is great for actually "rolling" dice. Say a 5D6 where the 
      marker set is the six faces of a six sided die. This feature would 
      also be great for games that use pictures rather than numbers for
      die faces.</li>
  <li>The board's selection list now includes markers.</li>
  <li>The board's selection list supports the use of the "Insert" and 
      "Delete" keys. These keys can be used selective remove objects 
      from the selection list. "Insert" keeps those highlighted in the 
      list. "Delete" removes those highlighted in the list.</li>
  <li>Markers now stack just like pieces.</li>
  <li>New "Auto Stack Deck" command that is used to stack selected items 
      using stagger values of zero.</li>
  <li>Toolbar buttons for plotted moves.</li>
  <li>The list of files recently opened (the so called LRU list) has 
      been increased to ten.</li>
  <li>The full path of the GameBox file is now stored in the Game file 
      so the GameBox can be in different areas of the file system than 
      the game file. This prevents your being prompted for its location 
      when loading the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.12 Release</h2>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A different style of cursor is displayed when you are recording a compound move.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
  <li>CBPlay.exe - The die roller now supports 100 faces on a die.</li>
  <li>CBPlay.exe - The cell visibility setting of a playing board is imported from 
    the GameBox when adding new boards in the Scenario designer.</li>
  <li>CBPlay.exe - The auto-stack feature now properly saves and restores negative offsets.</li>
  <li>CBDesign.exe - The rotate tile option of the main menu no longer disables forever if 
    the project window is selected.</li>
  <li>Tiles in board cells that use the transparent color for the small 
    image now work properly.</li>
  <li>Various other small bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.10 Release</h2>

<ul>
  <li>New icons for files and programs. These were done by Pokke (the same
    fellow who did the CyberBoard logos on the Web page). They are <i>much</i> nicer than my artistically
    challenged hacks.&nbsp;Sorry for the delay in getting these out Pokke!</li>
  <li>If the folder that contains CyberBoard is tagged as a <i> system</i> file then a
    nice CyberBoard icon will show up in the Windows file explorer for that folder. The
    batch file &quot;CBIcon.bat&quot; will do this for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Keyboard nudging of graphical objects within the board
        editor. Note that this is the <strong>*FIRST*</strong> 3rd
        party programmed feature addition for CyberBoard. It was
        programmed by Donald McLean. Thanks Donald! A very cool feature. Here is the
        key list:<ul>
            <li>Arrow (up, down, left, right) nudge selected
                components 1 pixel (or 1 grid width/length if
                grid turned on).</li>
            <li>Shift-arrow scroll window.</li>
            <li>Control-arrow nudge and scroll.</li>
            <li>Alt-arrow nudge 5 pixels (or 5 grid widths/lengths).</li>
            <li>Alt-Shift-Arrow fast scroll.</li>
            <li>Alt-Control-Arrow fast nudge/scroll.</li>
            <li>Page scroll window one page up or down.</li>
            <li>Control-Page (up, down) scroll window one page
                left or right.</li>
            <li>Home top of board.</li>
            <li>End bottom of board.</li>
            <li>Control-Home far left of board.</li>
            <li>Control-End far right of board.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The cell layer now supports tiles that have transparent regions. For
      backward compatibility this feature is off by default. To enable it for a
      playing board check &quot;Enable transparent tiles in cells&quot; in the
      Board Properties Dialog.</li>
    <li>You can now clone a playing board by right-clicking on the board name in
      the project window and selecting the &quot;Clone Selected Board&quot;
      command.</li>
    <li>The tile selection pane in the bitmap editor now supports scrolling so you can select
      different tiles even when the full scale tile is really large.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The main playing area can now be split vertically and horizontally. Each
      board view can be zoomed and scrolled independently. To use the feature
      select the Window menu or right click on a board view.</li>
    <li>The select list and tiny board view can now be hidden. To hide them,
      uncheck &quot;Show select list and tiny board view.&quot; in the Board
      Properties Dialog.</li>
    <li>The Scenario designer now supports automatically creating piece trays
      from the piece groupings defined in the gamebox file. See the command
      &quot;Create Trays from Piece Groups...&quot; on the &quot;Project&quot;
      menu.</li>
    <li>The die roller now supports rolling multiple sets of the specified roll.
      For instance, you could roll 50 2D6's at a time (if you're so inclined).</li>
    <li>The message view dialog now displays the entire history of messages that
      have been viewed during playback.</li>
    <li>The message entry dialog now displays the entire history of messages
      that have been entered during the current recording.</li>
    <li>A message can now be recorded without closing the send message dialog.</li>
    <li>If the pop-up map is too large for the screen it will be scaled down so
      all of it is visible.</li>
    <li>If you chose to discard a
      compound move, you are now prompted to verify your decision. This is to prevent accidental loss of moves.</li>
    <li>The delay between submoves of a compound move has been increased.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBDesign.exe - If you used the &quot;Apply Cell Mask&quot; feature in
      the tile editor and cancelled the dialog the program would crash. This embarrassing
      bug is now fixed.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - Importing move files that contain no moves will no longer
      enable the move stepping buttons. These buttons would cause the program to
      crash if used.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - names in marker tray are now alpha sorted.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - Tiles that are greater than 255 pixels in height are now
      truncated properly in lists. Note that due to a limitation in Windows
      listboxes items larger than 255 pixels are not possible.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - If the board cell grid is set to use very large cells in
      messes up the auto-scroll code. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.02 Release</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - The random number generator used for die
        rolls has been completely overhauled.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - Sort the tray name combo in the tray
        palettes by name. Also doubled the length of the combo
        box's drop down list.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - Fixed rare crash that occurred when merging
        move files with a new game created from a modified
        scenario. It occurred when the &quot;Use move game state
        is selected&quot; option was used.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe - Hitting the Close History button while moves
        were in mid-playback caused the program to crash.</li>
    <li>CBDesign - If tiles are deleted that aren't being used
        anywhere in the GameBox, don't consider it a major
        revision. This prevents messages about the GameBox file
        being newer than the game file when the file really is OK
        for play.</li>
    <li>CBDesign.exe - When drawing on tile bitmap images with a
        zero width pen nothing was rendered. Now the pen is
        assumed to be one pixel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The key &quot;F9&quot; toggles playing piece visibility.
        This is handy for a quick check of the underlying hexes.</li>
    <li>The key &quot;F10&quot; toggles between showing move
        indicator lines above the playing pieces or below them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.01 Release</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBDesign.exe - Sheesh! I screwed up the File/New command
        so it crashes the program &lt;blush&gt;. This update
        fixes it. Many thanks to Luca Saletti for reporting this
        so quickly!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0 Release</h2>

<p>Here it finally is...a version with no time limits!</p>

<p>The file format has not changed from the final beta version.
Existing games and gameboxes will work fine.</p>

<p><font color="#0000A0" size="4"><strong>Enjoy!</strong></font></p>

<h2>Beta 5.13 Board Editor Update Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBDesign.exe. Yet another bug exists in Beta 5.12 and
        earlier versions of the designer program that could cause
        a GameBox file to be damaged beyond repair. This is a
        very rare bug that only rears its ugly head on GameBoxes
        with many tiles of differening dimensions. Almost all
        users of the software will not be affected sinze they
        only use a small set of tile sizes. Those who have been
        impacted no doubt know about it already (as far as I know
        only one person was affected and I managed to repair his
        GameBox).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
    <p>The problem occurs when you hit an internal limit of the
    program. CyberBoard internally stores tiles in bitmaps called
    tile sheets. Tiles that are the same height and width are
    stored in the same tile sheet. If the a tile sheet gets too
    large I create a new tile sheet. CB supports up to 255 of
    these tile sheets. If you exceed 255 tile sheets the problem
    occurs. I never imagined in the early days of CB (in 16 bit
    Windows) that more than 255 tile sheets would be needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To really fix this I need to expand the number of tile
    sheets internally supported (which changes the GameBox file
    format) but this will produce GameBoxes that are not
    compatible with earlier versions of the program. For now,
    Beta 5.13 expands the allowable size of each tile sheet and
    more efficiently reuses tile sheets that are empty.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Beta 5.12 Board Editor Update Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBDesign.exe. A bug exists in Beta 5.11 and earlier
        versions of the designer program that could cause a
        GameBox file to be damaged beyond repair. This bug only
        rears its ugly head on VERY large GameBoxes. Almost all
        users of the software will not be affected. Those who
        have been impacted no doubt know about it already. This
        is a good news / bad news fix:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>The Good News</strong></p>
    <p>The bug is fixed. This bug has been in the program since
    its first release. Basically CB tries to keep the size of
    internal bitmaps (internally dubbed &quot;tile sheets&quot;)
    smaller than 4096 pixels high. A tile sheet contains tiles
    that are all the same height and width. The code that checks
    if a new tile sheet should be created was not working
    properly. The result: bitmaps that can be much taller than
    4096 pixels. GameBoxes that have exceeded this limit are OK
    until they exceed 65535 pixels--a very unlikely event.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bad News</strong></p>
    <p>Any gameboxes that have tile sheets larger than 65535
    pixels high are damaged for good. A rare occurrence but can
    happen. Tile sheets that are larger than 4096 but less than
    65535 will still work fine. </p>
    <p>A thousand apologies for any trouble this may have caused
    some folks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Beta 5.11 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This release was primarily made to provide a new date for the
program's &quot;Time-Bomb&quot;.</p>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBPlay.exe. If you used the window close button (X) of
        the message reading dialog, no other messages in the
        playback could be read.</li>
    <li>Both programs. Cyberboard files types are no longer
        available on the Windows &quot;New&quot; menu (normally
        seen by right clicking in the Windows Explorer).
        CyberBoard doesn't support this feature.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe. Two sided playing pieces using different
        sized tiles on each side didn't properly repaint when
        flipped over.</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe. When changing a playing board's zoom level
        CyberBoard now tries to maintain the center of the view (if
        possible). This should give more consistant results when
        zooming in and out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>There is a new board properties option called &quot;Automatically
        Show Board on Open&quot;. If this is checked, the board
        will automatically be viewed when you open that Game or
        Scenario file. (Happy Bart?)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 5.10 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>CBDesign.exe. Fixed a bug in the PolyGon drawing tool
        that made it impossible to draw right and bottom areas of
        a board. I accidentally introduced this bug in Beta 5.08.
        Sorry about that!</li>
    <li>CBPlay.exe. The popup mini-board now can be dismissed
        without affecting the main board. Either hit the ESC key
        or click off of the mini-board window.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The polygon board drawing tool functionality has been
        extended to allow &quot;free-hand&quot; drawing. Just
        hold the mouse button down and scribble.</li>
    <li>A new color changer tool has been added to the tile
        editor. It works just like the paint bucket (flood fill)
        tool except that all colors in the bitmap that match the
        clicked color are changed to the new color.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>An &quot;Indicators on Top&quot; command has been added
        to the &quot;View&quot; menu. Indicators are the lines
        and boxes that indicate piece movement during playback.</li>
    <li>A &quot;Single Step Compound Moves&quot; command has been
        added to the &quot;Playback&quot; menu. This command
        allows you to step through a compound move to see every
        piece of it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 5.08 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a NASTY crash bug in CBDesign.exe. The crash was
        most likely to occur if a session of program use was very
        long and you were doing a lot of bitmap editing (copies,
        pastes, etc.). Basically the program was leaking bitmap
        resources. When you close the program the resources were
        reclaimed. In rare cases you could cause Win95 to operate
        strangely since it would get resource starved. This
        problem wouldn't show itself on Windows NT since NT
        essentially provides an &quot;unlimited&quot; amount of
        resources. This is why I never saw it--I do my program
        development in Windows NT. A special thanks goes out to
        Tim Cropley who reported the crash problem and worked
        tirelessly with me to nail it. He gave very good bug
        reports that helped me narrow the problem down. THANKS
        TIM!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 5.06 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Send message dialog. If you type text after rolling dice,
        that text wasn't recorded.</li>
    <li>Die roller security hole. It has been pointed out to me (thanks
        Paul!) that a person could simply type in text that looks
        like a die roll to get the results they want. Duh. I'll
        admit it never occurred to me. To prevent this, all lines
        of text produced by the die roller now have a chevron
        character (<font color="#FF0000">»</font>) prefixing
        them. The editable areas of the send message dialog no
        longer allow this character to be typed or pasted into a
        message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 5.05 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<h2>Beta 5.04 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Die Roller. Yep...you heard right. I guess I can be
        convinced to do something if I get hit in the head enough!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>The die roller is integrated into the message send dialog.
    When you roll dice the message edit area is converted into a
    read-only part and an editable part. The results of the roll
    as well as any message text typed thus far are transferred
    into the read-only area to discourage &quot;adjustments&quot;
    to the results. Also, the ability to discard the message is
    thereafter disabled. If the roll had a problem the player
    would need to inform the opponent via the editable message
    area.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>A quick navigation feature has been added to the tiny
        overview map. If you right click on the tiny map you'll
        get a pop up version of it that you can click on to
        quickly jump about in the main map window.</li>
    <li>Playback truncation. You can now discard the trailing
        parts of a move playback. To use this, step to the place
        in the playback that you want to use as the new starting
        position of the game and select menu command &quot;Playback/Accept
        Move File Playback...&quot;. You will be presented with a
        dialog that gives you the option of discarding the
        remainder of the moves.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>Truncating the move file playback is useful for recovering
    from a hopelessly flawed set of moves. You would resume play
    at the state of the game where the playback was truncated.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>When you are playing back a move file, the title and
        description of the file are now associated with the
        &lt;Move File Playback&gt; line of the project window.</li>
    <li>You can now save a bitmap image of a playing board
        directly into a disk file.</li>
    <li>There is now a menu command that allows you to select all
        markers that were created from a specific marker group.
        This is useful for only deleting a specific class of
        markers.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>One use for this feature would be to have a marker group
    that contains markers used to indicate a piece has moved. So
    you would move a piece, mark it, move another piece, mark it,
    and so on. When all your pieces are moved, use the menu
    command &quot;Select All Markers From &gt;&quot; and pick the
    group that has the &quot;moved piece&quot; markers and hit
    the delete key. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>F1 key now pops up the Help file.</li>
    <li>Using a &quot;net&quot; selection rectangle that clicks
        on the lower right and drags to the upper left now works
        properly.</li>
    <li>A weird bug related to exporting game history records to
        a move file has been corrected. For the few people it
        impacted the bug gave the appearance of saving a previous
        move recording.</li>
    <li>Some problems with the snap grid, which occurred when
        dragging multiple pieces, have been corrected.</li>
    <li>Other little nits...here and there.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 5.01 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Problem with snap grid when dragging multiple selected
        pieces. Now uses the piece clicked on for snap grid
        reference.</li>
    <li>Loading history record caused complaint about a missing
        playing board. If you get this message the game file is
        probably corrupted. Save the game file as a scenario and
        work from there. Problem is caused by too much text in
        the scenario description.</li>
    <li>In half size board scale drags left artifacts if half
        piece size was odd number of pixels.</li>
    <li>New Scenarios should inherit the snap grid settings from
        the GameBox.</li>
    <li>When pieces are moved around on the playing board they
        now remain selected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 5 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This beta of CyberBoard contains all the features that will be
in the final release. I don't intend to add any more major
features before the first unrestricted version is posted.</p>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Context menus have been added to the right mouse button
        for most of the windows in the program. </li>
    <li>You can now edit existing text fields on the map window
        by selecting and double-clicking them. </li>
    <li>You can now copy an existing drawing layer bitmap to the
        clipboard. Just select the bitmap on one of the playing
        board drawing layers and use the Edit/Copy menu command. </li>
    <li>ToolTips have been added to the color picker window to
        clarify its use. </li>
    <li>The board creation dialog now displays pixel dimensions
        of a candidate board.</li>
    <li>Some small bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Context menus have been added to the right mouse button
        for most of the windows in the program. </li>
    <li>A new way of specifying moves called <i>Compound Moves</i>
        has been added. Compound moves allow you group an
        arbitrary sequence of single moves so they are played
        back as a single animated sequence of moves. For example,
        you could move a piece, rotate it and move it again as a
        single compound move. Upon playback your opponent will
        see the move as a single animated sequence. The Actions
        menu has the new commands for compound moves. </li>
    <li>A new way to rotate playing pieces called <i>Incremental
        Rotation</i> has been added. Incremental rotation is done
        directly on the board so you can see the exact piece
        facing before committing to it. To do this, select a
        piece and use the Actions/Rotate Piece - Incremental menu
        command. You'll be presented with a popup window that you
        can use to rotate the piece either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
    </li>
    <li>You can now step backwards through the moves during
        playback. When you step back a move you'll see a replay
        of the previous move.</li>
    <li>The small overview map can be used to jump around on the
        main map view. The main view is centered on wherever you
        click the mouse in the small map.</li>
    <li>You can now save the current state of game play as a
        scenario file.</li>
    <li>Some small bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 4 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This release of CyberBoard is mainly composed of bug fixes.</p>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You may now toggle whether or not the Select tool is
        automatically reselected after drawing with another tool.
        The toggle is available under the Project menu. </li>
    <li>You may now change the fingerprint of a GameBox. The
        fingerprint is a unique numeric ID that enables Game
        files to identify the GameBox they below with. The
        probable use of this feature is to make a new GameBox
        based on another GameBox. Once you change the finger
        print the GameBox will not work with any scenario and
        game files that were associated with them. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug in initial default snap grid values. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug that prevented app from being restored from a
        minimized state if a palette window was open. </li>
    <li>Some small bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a NASTY bug that prevented games history records
        from being loaded and replayed in pre-beta3 files. If you
        double-clicked on a game history record and it didn't
        work you were victimized by the bug. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug in initial default snap grid values. </li>
    <li>Fixed bug that prevented app from being restored from a
        minimized state if tray or marker windows were open. </li>
    <li>Some small bugs. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Beta 3 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You can now save and load tile libraries (file extension <strong>gtl</strong>).
        The file format is documented in file <strong>GTLFormat.txt</strong>
        so programmer types can create ad-hoc tile generation
        programs whose output can be directly imported into
        CyberBoard. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>To create a tile library select the tiles you wish to save
    using the project window. Then use menu command Project/Save
    Tile Library File to specify the filename. To load a tile
    library select the tile group you wish to load the tiles into
    (in the project window) and use the menu command Project/Load
    Tile Library File.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>You can now specify fractions of a pixel when setting up
        snap grids. </li>
    <li>Various adjustments to the menus. </li>
    <li>Bug Fixes. </li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>

        into a bitmap file. </li>
    <li>You can now specify fractions of a pixel when setting up
        snap grids. </li>
    <li>Various adjustments to the menus. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Beta 2 Release Notes</h2>

<h3>New features for CBDesign.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>When working with Tiles in the project window you may now
        select more than one in the list box. </li>
    <li>You can now copy tiles (Ctrl+C) selected in the tile list
        shown in the project window onto the clipboard. You may
        then paste (Ctrl+V) them into tilesets in any GameBox. </li>
    <li>You can now rearrange tiles in the tile window by using
        the mouse to drag and drop them. </li>
    <li>You can now move tiles from one tileset to another by
        using the clipboard. To do this: select and copy the
        tiles you want to move to the clipboard (Ctrl+C) using
        the tile list in the project window. Then select the new
        tile set and use menu File/Move (Ctrl+M) to move them. </li>
    <li>Added toolbar button for leaving history playback mode.
        The free form drawing layers of the board editor now
        allow you to paste an arbitrary Windows bitmap from the
        clipboard or a file directly onto the board. You can then
        move it around as you would any drawing object. </li>
</ul>

<h3>New features for CBPlay.exe</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added menu handling for accepting or discarding a
        playback of a move file. This was and still is an option
        available in the project window. It was put on the main
        menu to make it easier to find and more intuitive. </li>
    <li>If the move file is accepted rather than discarded, the
        moves are entered into the game history log and the final
        board state (piece locations etc.) are now considered the
        current state of the game. </li>
    <li>Added ability to copy a bitmap image of a complete game
        board to the Windows Clipboard. One possible use would be
        to paste the image into Windows Paint so you could print
        it. </li>
</ul>
